# mtu-crn-ahk
A simple AutoHotKey script for inputting class CRNs into MTU's BanWeb system.

# Installation
This program requires AutoHotKey **v1**, NOT v2.

# Usage
First, Make sure all the correct class CRNs are included in the `crns` array of `crns.json`. Then, once the AHK script has been started with v1, ensure the first text box is selected and use the keybind `Shift + n` to input the CRNs into the BanWeb text entries.
